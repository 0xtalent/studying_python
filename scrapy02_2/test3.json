{"contents": "The manual method of discovery for gauging online public sentiment towards a product, company, or industry is cursory at best, and at worst, may harm your business by providing incorrect or misleading insights.Simply put, this data can only be properly aggregated to any useful extent if generated in quantities too large for manual input, and web scraping such data has therefore become best-practice across the world\u2019s many public-facing industries.Sentiment analysis can transform the subjective emotions of the public into quantitative insight that a company or leader can use to drive change. Let's look at some popular use cases for online public sentiment data:The market moves quickly, and being even half a step ahead of the competition can be incredibly valuable. If many firms are receiving the same traditional data, investors can differentiate their strategy (and bolster their earnings) by incorporating sentiment data into their decision making. Sentiment data can inform the investment process by predicting future firm fundamentals or stock returns plus event-based sentiment analysis can show savvy investors when to move.Any business intelligence strategy is incomplete without an understanding of public sentiment. The way a company\u2019s product or service is portrayed in news articles and reviews directly impacts its bottom line. By scraping qualitative public sentiment data about your product from the web, businesses can integrate this information directly into AI-driven business solutions to produce actionable insights into which products are performing - or underperforming - and why. The uses for sentiment data across the product monitoring are diverse. Here are a few examples: polarity analysis, social media monitoring, aspect-based text analysis, and website variance."},
